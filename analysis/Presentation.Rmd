# Disclosure Definition `r emo::ji("floppy_disk")` 

.panelset.sideways[

.panel[.panel-name[Dalenius (1977)]  

*“If the release of the statistics S makes it possible to determine the value [of some characteristic] more accurately than is possible without access to S, a disclosure has taken place. — Dalenius (1977)”*

This leads onto the discussion onto what characteristics in the data are important. Ofcourse, considering all characteristics of the data gives absolutely no information about the underlying population. 

]

.panel[.panel-name[Dwork (2006)]  

Differential Privacy notion of disclosure :
* Auxillary Information Risk: 
    Access to a database should not allow anyone to identify an individual whose information cannot be known without this database.
    *Example: Assume that the database yields the average salaries of women from different nationalities. A person who has access to this database and the auxiliary information that “S Jones earns $4000 more than the average Australian woman” learns S Jones’ salary, while anyone knowing only the auxiliary information, without access to the average salaries, learns relatively little.*


* *an auxiliary information generator with information about someone not even in the database can cause a privacy breach to this person. In order to sidestep this issue we change from absolute guarantees about disclosures to relative ones: any given disclosure will be, within a small multiplicative factor, just as likely whether or not the individual participates in the database. As a consequence, there is a nominally increased risk to the individual in participating, and only nominal gain to be had by concealing or misrepresenting one’s data. — Dwork (2006)*

]

.panel[.panel-name[maximum-knowledge-intruder perspective]  

* Disclosure scenarios when any aspect of the original data could already be public knowledge, known as the maximum-knowledge-intruder perspective Ruiz et al. (2018). 

* It is important to note that in this situation, we are merely intending to ensure that any existing knowledge can not be leveraged to obtain a greater understanding of confidential information.

# Statistical Disclosure Control Methods `r emo::ji("control")` 

.bold[A trade-off exists between the .green[statistical utility] of the data and the .red[disclosure risk] associated. ]
  - Example: if we group all records in one group, then there is no meaning to clustering.
  


These types of methods include: 
* .bold[the addition of random noise] (Fuller, 1993; Shlomo, 2010)

* .bold[micro-aggregation] (Domingo-Ferrer and Mateo-Sanz (2002))

* .bold[rounding, rank and record swapping] (Nin et al., 2008; Dalenius and Reiss, 1982)

* .bold[data shuffling] (Muralidhar and Sarathy, 2006; Burridge, 2003) 

* .bold[Multiple Imputation with Multimodal Perturbation] (Melville and McQuaid (2012))

# Disclosure Framework
(distinctness, accuracy and undeniability)


---

# Disclosure Framework `r emo::ji("computer")` 

In this work, the disclosure risk assessment formulated by Bradley Wakefield can be used for measuring disclosure risk universally based on three key principles: .bold[distinctness, accuracy and undeniability]. 

.panelset.sideways[
.panel[.panel-name[Scope]  
.content-box-neutral[Using these principles, we can obtain a disclosure risk measure associated with the release of protected data, 
- irrespective of what mechanism was used to protect it. 
- despite a difference in dimensionality between the original and protected data-sets.
- without assuming any particular joint probability structure between the original and protected data.

.content-box-duke-green[.blue[.bold[Assumption:]] we note that when referring to micro-data, we assume there is 
.bold[ at least one continuous variable in the data-set].]]

.panel[.panel-name[Disclosure Definition]  

```{r echo=FALSE}

```


]
.panel[.panel-name[Ellaboration]  
Disclosure, in .bold[ Definition 1]., is defined in terms of three key principles: distinctness, accuracy and undeniability. More simply put in order to have a disclosure 

(1) we need the observation value to be a sensitive characteristic (something likely pertaining to the individual only) within our original data-set (.bold[distinct]), 

(2) we need to be able to properly estimate this observation based on the release of information (.bold[accurately estimated]) and,

(3) we need our estimate to be able to be attributed with this observation with some level of certainty (.bold[undeniable]).

# Determining if an observation is disclosed.
.pull-left[.content-box-yellow[.bold.Large[Plausible Deniability]: 

The greater the density of observations within a particular region of our sample 
space, the harder it is we can use this estimate to distinguish this observation from other observations in the space.]]

# Disclosure Scores 
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[drscore]

* The primary results from drscore are given as .bold[Linkcounts] and .bold[Linkscore].

* Linkcounts has all the key combinations of categorical variables and numeral differences between the two data sets and potential matches such as outliers.

* Linkscore is the overall disclosure risk and other proportions that we’d like to estimate — distinct, accurately estimated and undeniable.

* Two widely used distances used in this package are Mahalanobis Distance and Euclidean Distance. 
]
.panel[.panel-name[update]
* Update mainly avoids re-calculation of the distances to save computation time. 

* It takes previous parameters from the DRisk object of the drscore. 

* Distances are re-calculated only when the neighborhood is different.
